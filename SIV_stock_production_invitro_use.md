# Production of Large-scale SIV Stock 
## For In vitro use

This protocol is for making large-scale, high-titer SIV stocks for use in in vitro assays. We’ve found that this method, with its initial coculture of Vero and CEMx174 cells, gives the most infectious high-titer stocks.  However, production in CEMx174 has disadvantages if you want to use the virus for in vivo studies, particularly for multiple low-dose challenges. CEMx174 is a human cell line, so virus particles grown in these cells will incorporate human antigens. There is a risk that multiple mucosal challenges with such a virus will engender a xenoreactive response, essentially immunizing animals against further challenge. For this reason, we prefer to use virus stocks expanded on rhesus PBMC for in vivo challenge.

**Note about the CEMx174 cultures:** The peak titer of SIV recovered from this method depends critically on the quality of the CEMx174 cell stock. Healthy cell cultures form clumpy aggregates that are easily visible to the naked eye. Disaggregated, “smoky” cultures won’t support the rapid cell-to-cell spread of virus that’s necessary for extremely high titer production. Make sure your CEMx174 cells are healthy before starting this protocol!

**Note about timing of peak virus replication:** This protocol assumes that the peak of syncytium formation will occur around day 11 of the procedure. It may occur earlier or later, depending on the efficiency of initial transfection, fitness of virus constructs, etc. It is imperative to watch cultures daily to assess virus replication. When syncytia spread throughout the culture, begin harvesting. You can replace s/n and do additional harvests until the syncytia disappear.

## Procedure

Day -1: Plate adherent cells; prepare plasmid DNA

1. Prepare adherent cells:

    1. Trypsinize adherent Vero cells and plate at ~0.5 million cells/well in 3 ml R10 in a 6 well plate
    2. Incubate overnight at 37C

2. Molecular biology steps:
   
    1. Cut 5 ug of each plasmid according to manufacturer's recommendations for the enzyme
    2. SAP treat 5' digests by adding 0.1 volume 10x SAP buffer and 1 ul SAP. Incubate 15 min - 1 hour at 37C, then heat inactivate the SAP for 20 min at 65C
    3. Combine the 5' and 3' plasmids and bring to 200 ul with sterile water
    4. Add 2 ul Pellet Paint, vortex
    5. Add 0.1 volumes 3 M NaOAc, vortex
    6. Add 2.5 volumes 95% EtOH, vortex and spin 5 min at 14,000rpm 
    7. Wash pellet with 70% EtOH, vortex and spin 5 min at 14,000rpm
    8. Wash with 95% EtOH, vortex and spin 5 min at 14,000rpm
    9. Dry pellet and re-suspend in 15 ul sterile water
    10. Add 4 ul 5x ligase buffer and 1 ul ligase. Note: Tips should be discarded in bleach to nuetralize potentially infectious ligated virus
    11. Run ligation program on thermal cycler overnight: 11C for 1 hour, then 20C for 1 hour, repeating indefinitely

Day 0: Transfect adherent cells; split CEMx174 cells

1. Aliquot 250 ul serum-free medium into two 15 ml conical tubes for each transfection
2. Add 5 ug DNA to the serum-free medium in one tube. Mix gently, no vortexing
3. Add 10 ul Lipofectamine 2000 to the other tube containing serum-free medium and vortex
4. Incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature
5. Add the DNA mix to the Lipofectamine tube and mix gently by pipetting
6. Incubate for 20 minutes at room temperature
7. During the incubation, prepare the CEMx174 cells for overlay tomorrow by splitting 1:3 (be sure to save enough culture for the overlay and to propagate the cell line)
8. Add the DNA/Lipofectamine mixture to the Vero cells (in 6 well plates) dropwise, distributing the drops across the surface of the well. When you are done, gently rock the plate, but do not swirl as this may concentrate the transfection mix in the center of the well, potentially causing toxicity to cells.
9. Incubate cells overnight at 37C

Day 1: Overlay CEMx174 cells on Vero cells

1. Pellet 2 million CEMx174 cells per transfection
2. Decant supernatant and re-suspend the CEMx174 cells at 0.5 million cells/ml in R10
3. Remove the medium from the Vero cells
4. Add 4 ml (2 million cells) of the CEMx174 culture to each well of Vero cells that was transfected
5. Incubate the cells at 37C for 48 hours

Day 2: Add medium to cells

1. Add 3 ml R10 to each well 

Day 3: Transfer CEMx174 cells to T75 flasks

1. Confirm that Vero cells are still adherent
2. Aspirate the supernatant containing the CEMx174 cells using a 5 ml pipet. Tilting the plate, carefully wash down the Vero cells a couple times to dislodge any CEMx174s that may be sticking there. Don't be so harsh as to dislodge Vero cells. Transfer the CEMx174 containing supernatant to a T75 flask
3. Split the CEMx174 cells 1:3 by adding 14 ml R10 the flask, bringing the total volume to 21 ml
4. You can sample 0.5 ml supernatant daily to track virus production by viral load. There should be an obvious peak around day 14 (day 12 after infection of CEMx174 cells)

Day 5: Split culture 1:2

1. Feed cells by adding 25 ml R10 to flask. The total volume will now be 46 ml. From here on out, observe culture daily for syncytium formation

Days 7 and 9: Split cultures

1. Split cultures 1:2 by removing 23 ml culture (place in new flask if desired, otherwise discard). Add 23 ml fresh R10
2. Observe culture for syncytium formation. There should be a sudden "bloom" of syncytia throughtout the culture around day 11

Day 10: Prepare culture for harvest

1. In order to ensure that the virus stock is made of fresh virus produced within the last 24 hours we will replace all media a day before we anticipate harvesting
2. Pellet cells and re-suspend in fresh R10 in an equal volume to the original volume

Day 11: First harvest

1. If syncytia have spread to most cell clumps, it’s time to harvest. Transfer cultures to 50-ml conicals and spin down, 630 rcf 5 min
2. Pool supernatants and pass through a filter unit
3. Re-suspend CEMx1784 cells in fresh R10 at the original volume and return to the T75 flask. Incuabte 24 hours then repeat the harvest procedure
4. Aliquot filtered supernatant into 1.8 ml cryotubes in either 0.5 ml or 1 ml aliquots
5. For long-term storage of the virus stock, liquid nitrogen is recommended, but -80 is ok for short term storage
6. Test one aliquot of stock for vRNA content by QRT-PCR

Day 12: Second harvest

1. Peak virus production often occurs ~2 days after peak syncytium formation. It’s therefore a good idea to do at least one additional harvest of s/n from infected cells. So, two days after initial harvest, first observe cultures. As the peak of virus production occurs, huge-ass syncytia will disappear from the culture. You should see lots of debris from dead, exploded cells. If you see that, this will be your last harvest. If there are still obvious large syncytia, you can replace supernatant again and harvest once more tomorrow
2. Transfer cultures to 50-ml conicals and spin down, 630 rcf 5 min
3. Pool supernatants and pass through a filter unit
4. Aliquot filtered supernatant into 1.8 ml cryotubes in either 0.5 ml or 1 ml aliquots
5. For long-term storage of the virus stock, liquid nitrogen is recommended, but -80 is ok for short term storage
6. Test one aliquot of stock for vRNA content by QRT-PCR
