# TCID50 Assay for SIV

### Author: Andrea Weiler
### Date: 2019-03-28

### Purpose: This protocol is for determining the infectivity of an SIV stock, virus isolate or sample. The results are reported as tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)50. This particular protocol uses CEMx174 cells for measuring infectivity and may not be ideal for certain viruses, such as SHIVs, that do not infect CEMx174 cells particularly well. For those viruses there is a similar protocol using PBMC.

## Materials needed: 
Sample to be tested

CEMx174 cells (split the day before assay set-up; about 2e6 cells are needed)

R10 (RPMI media supplemented with 10%FBS, 1% L-gluatamine, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic)

15 ml conical tubes

Flat bottom 96-well plate

SIV p27 Antigen ELISA kit (Zeptometrix 0801169)


## Procedure
1. Thaw samples at room temperature in BSC
2. While sample is thawing, count CEMx174 cells using a haemacytometer, by trypan exclusion
3. Pellet 2 million CEMx174 cells per sample being tested by spinning for 5 min at 530 rcf. (In the end you want to plate 50,000 cells per well in 200 µl R10 for a cell density of 250,000/ml. You’ll prepare 8 serial 4-fold dilutions and quadruplicate samples: 8 x 4 = 32 wells x 50,000 = 1.6 million cells per experiment. Therefore to have some extra, pellet 2 million cells.)
4. Prepare dilutions of sample: For stocks we generally test a 1:4 dilution series, starting at a 1:100 dilution of the stock, but you could use different dilutions if appropriate
    1. label 7 x 15 ml conical tubes 1-7
    2. aliquot 5 ml R10 to tube #1 and 3 ml to each of the subsequent tubes
    3. Add 50 ul of virus stock to tube 1 and mix thouroughly by pipetting
    4. Using a new pipet, remove 1 ml diluted virus from tube 1 and add it to tube 2. Mix thoroughly
    5. Repeat the process just described in step 4 for each tube in the dilution series
5. Re-suspend the CEMx174 cells at 0.5 million cells/ml in R10. This will give (cell density = 50,000 per 100 µl, we will plate 100 ul per well)
6.  Aliquot 100 µl cells into the appropriate wells of the 96 well plate. Plate 4 wells per dilution, plus 4 additional wells for the mock infection
7. Add 100 µl R10 to each mock infected well
8. Add 25 µl virus dilution o the appropriate wells
9. Add 75 µl R10 to the wells to bring the final volume to 200 µl
10. Add 200 µl millipore water to empty wells in the plate. This helps minimize evaporation from sample wells
11. Feed as needed (every 2-3 days) by removing 100 µl supernatant and replacing it with 100 µl fresh R10. Be careful not to remove too many cells!
12. On day 14 post-inoculation read out assay by p27 ELISA. Briefly centrifuge plate to pellet cells. Use 50 ul supernatant from each well in the p27 ELISA, following instructions in the kit.
13. Calculate TCID50 using the proportionate distance method (see attached example for explanation)
