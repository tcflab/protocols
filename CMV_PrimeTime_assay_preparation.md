# Ordering the CMV_UL54 PrimeTime assay from IDT

## This reagent is ordered from IDT (idtdna.com) and can easily be found by searching for "primetime qpcr probe assays"

1. Once on the PrimeTime qPCR Probe Assays webpage, choose the manual sequence entry button (see attached/accompanying screenshot of order entry)
2. Enter the assay name (CMV_UL54) in the provided space
3. Make sure the scale of the assay is set to Std for 500 reactions at 20 ul
4. Change the Primer:Probe ratio to 3:1
5. Enter the primer and probe sequences as listed below (written 5'-3'):
    
       forward primer: GATGGGACCGCTCAAGTTTC

       reverse primer: TGACGGTAGCGAGGAGACAA

       probe: GGTCGATGGGGTTTTGACTCACGA

6. Select the 5'Dye/3'Quencher combination (recommended is 6FAM/ZEN/IBFQ)
7. When you select order you may get a warning about a guanidine next to a fluorophore. You can ignore this by just hitting continue
8. IDT will encourage you to purchase a master mix, but since we do not need these, just leave the quanitity as 0 and proceed with the order


# Preparing the CMV_UL54 PrimeTime Assay

## materials needed:

CMV_UL54 PrimeTime Assay

TE buffer (ex: IDTE 1x TE buffer, catalog number 11-05-01-13)

0.2 ml PCR strip tubes 

## Resuspending the CMV_UL54 Assay

1. Spin the tube containing the lyophilized assay for at least 10 seconds to ensure that primers/probe are at the bottom of the tube
2. The standard size assay will deliver 7.5 nanomol each primer and 2.5 nanomol probe. To resuspend this at a 20x concentration add 1250 ul 1x TE buffer. Let sit at room temp for 2 minutes, then vortex well. Spin down the tube again.
3. Store the assay in single use aliquots in 0.2 ml strip tubes at -20C.
