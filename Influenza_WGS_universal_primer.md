# Influenza Whole genome sequencing using universal primer 

**Author**: Wanting Wei 
**Date**: 2023-05-25  
**Materials**: Catalog numbers for reagents and materials are listed within the protocol. 

**Purpose**: To generate whole genome sequecing data for Influenza A/ Influenza B vrius.
 
Notes: 
- *This protocols assumes are you starting with high-quality, purified vRNA*. 
- This protocol is really senstive to ramp speed. I am using Veritiâ„¢ 96-Well Fast Thermal Cycler (Cat #: Themofisher 4375305). And I changed the ramp speed to 33.33% for all the step.
