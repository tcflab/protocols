# DNA Isolation for CMV viral load testing

##  Materials needed:

Zymo QuickDNA Miniprep kit (catalog # D3024)

DEPC water

1.5 ml snap-cap microcentrifuge tubes

## DNA isolation protocol using QuickDNA kit:
1. Aliquot 200 ul of each plasma or whole blood sample to a 1.5 ml snap-cap tube
2. Add 800 ul genomic lysis buffer to the sample (resulting in 4:1 ratio buffer:sample) and vortex well, followed by a quick spin to remove droplets from lid
3. Incubate for 10 minutes at room temperature
4. Transfer 500 ul of sample to spin column (placed in provided collection tube)
5. Spin for 1 minute at 10,000 x g, then discard flow-through and place column back in collection tube
6. Repeat steps 4-5 to transfer remaining sample to spin column. Following the second spin, discard the collection tube and flow-through. Place spin column in new collection tube
7. Wash column by adding 200 ul pre-wash buffer and spinning for 1 minute at 10,000 x g (it is not necessary to pour out flow-through at this step)
8. Add 500 ul g-DNA wash buffer and spin for 1 minute at      10,000 x g
9. Transfer column to a 1.5 ml snap-cap tube 
10. Add 50 ul DEPC water directly to the fitler and incubate for 5 minutes at room temperature
11. Elute DNA by spinning at top speed for 30 seconds
12. DNA should be used for CMV VL QPCR or stored at -20C
