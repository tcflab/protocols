# Preparation of the CMV_UL54 QPCR standard

##  Materials needed:
1.5 ml Non-stick RNase-free tubes (Ambion catalog # AM12450)

DEPC water

CMV DNA standard aliquot

## Diluting the CMV DNA standard:
1. Label 7 of the 1.5 ml non-stick tubes to make a 7 point ten-fold dilution series
2. Carefully aliquot 45 ul DEPC water into each of the 7 tubes, making sure to pipet accurately
3. Add 5 ul of the CMV DNA standard to the first dilution tube. Mix this dilution well by pipetting the entire volume up and down carefully using either a 100 or 200 ul pipet.
4. Transfer 5 ul of the first dilution to the second dilution tube and mix by pipetting as described in step 3.
5. Repeat these steps to complete the dilution series
6. 5 ul of each dilution will be used (in duplicate) in the QPCR assay

The dilution series will have the following concentrations: 

Label | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4| 5 | 6 | 7 | X
