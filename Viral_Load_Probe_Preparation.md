# **Viral Load Probe Preparation**
**Author:** Sierra Rybarczyk

**Date:** 3/28/2019

### **Materials:**

- Probe (resuspended in TE buffer to 100 uM)

- 1 x TE buffer pH 7.4 

- colored PCR 8-tube strips with individually attached caps

- 1.5 mL  or 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube

### **Purpose:**

- To prepare 10 uM aliquots of probe to be placed in single-use strip tubes for qRT-PCR

### **Methods:**

- Combine 1 x TE with probe to dilute it to 10 uM in a 1.5mL or 2.0mL Eppendorf tube. Add the appropriate volumes of reagents according to the table below or based on how much probe you would like to prepare.

| **makes ___ 14 uL aliquots**  | **100 uM Probe (uL)** | **1 x TE (uL)** | **Total Volume (uL)**
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| 53 | 75 | 675 | 750 |
| 107 | 150 | 1350 | 1500 |

- Mix by inverting, pipetting up and down, and/or vortexing.

- Aliquot into (usually pink) strip tubes. We normally do aliquots of 14 uL (enough for a 60x reaction) or sometimes I do aliquots of 18 uL (enough for an 85x reaction) because this perfectly fits a run of 30 samples (which we usually do for ZIKV tissues and on the Maxwell because that's the max capacity of the centrifuge).

  - The P and K are modified bases that we use in our probe. They bind certain combinations of bases with equal efficiency. They are available through Biosearch Technologies.
