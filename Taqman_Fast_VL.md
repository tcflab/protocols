# **Viral Load qPCR Protocol using the TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix:**
**Author:** Sierra Rybarczyk

**Date:** 9/10/2019

### **Materials:**
- 1.5ml non-stick RNase-free Microcentrifuge Tubes (Cat. No. AM12450)
- DEPC-water (Cat. No. AM9920)
- RNase-Out (Cat. No. 10777-019)
- TaqMan™ Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Cat. No. 4444434) - Includes DNA Polymerase, Reverse Transcriptase, dNTPs, RNase Out
- primer aliquot
- probe aliquot
- transcript aliquot
- LightCycler 480 multiwell plate 96 (with sealing foil) (Cat. No. 04729692001)

### **Purpose:**

- To prepare a 96 well plate for qRT-PCR. We commonly test SIV or ZIKV and fill our plate with 10 standards in duplicate and a maximum of 38 samples in duplicate for qRT-PCR.

### **Methods:**

1.	Clean the hood for qPCR with 10% bleach and 70% ethanol. 
Bleach off two eppendorf racks and a tip discard bucket and place them into the hood.
2.	Prepare ~800ul (or as much as needed) RNase-Out containing DEPC-water in a 1.5mL non-stick tube by mixing 800uL of DEPC-water and 8uL of RNase-out (1:100).
3.  Prepare 10 standards in 1.5mL non-stick tubes by labeling them 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Aliquot 45uL RNase-Out-containing water to standard tubes 0-7, and 20uL into 8-9. Tube 0 is going to be a discard tube and tubes 1-7 will be ten-fold dilutions from 15M to 15. Tube 8 will be a 1:3 dilution of 7 and Tube 9 will be a 1:5 dilution of 7 to produce standards of 5 and 3, respectively.
4.  Prepare a 1.5mL non-stick tube (or 2.0mL if necessary) for the master mix. Make the master mix according to the recipe for X samples +10% (shown below and posted on static hood in clean room). You will be combining RNase-Out-containing water, primer aliquot, probe aliquot, and the TaqMan Mix.

**Master Mix Recipe**

| **Reagent**  | **Stock** | **one 20uL rxn** |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| Water (w/RNase Out) |  | 4.2uL |
| 4x Taqman Master Mix (w/ enzyme) | 4x | 5.0uL |
| 600nM F/R primer + 7.5ng/uL random hexamers | 10uM | 0.6uL |
| 100nM probe | 10uM | 0.2uL |
| RNA |  | 10uL |

5.	Dilute out the standard curve
-	Add 5ul of the initial 3E+08 copies/uL transcript aliquot to 0 (first tube in standard curve)
-   mix by pipetting using the p100 set to 45uL
-	Change tip
-	Add 5ul of 0 to 1
-   mix by pipetting using the p100 set to 45uL
-	Change tip
-	(Continue this way until dilution 7)
-	Change tip
-	Add 10uL of dilution 7 to dilution 8, mix by pipetting
-	Change tip
-	Add 5ul of dilution 7 to dilution 9, mix by pipetting (**9 is not a dilution of 8)

6.	Aliquot out the master mix into the wells of a LightCycler 480 multiwell plate 96 and then add standard curve and samples to their respective wells. 
-	Add 10ul of the master mix to each well of a 96-well reaction plate
-	Add 10ul of each standard curve dilution in duplicate to the first 18 wells
-	Add 10ul of water in duplicate to the next 2 wells
-	Add 10ul of each sample in duplicate to the remaining wells

7.  Stick a seal on the top of the plate. Press down using a roller or some other flat device. Centrifuge the plate down for 1 minute at max speed.

8.  Turn on/start heating the lid of a Lightcycler 96 or 480. Insert the plate and run according to the following settings:

**Machine Settings**
|   | **Temperature (°C)**  | **Time** | **Ramp Rate for LC96 and LC480 (°C/s)** |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |------------- |
| RT | 50 | 5 min | 4.4 |
| Denaturation | 95 | 20 s | 4.4 |
| Amplification (50 cycles) | 95 | 15s | 3.0 |
|  | 60 for ZIKV / 62 for SIV | 1 min | 2.2 |
| Cooling | 40 | 30s | 2.2 |
