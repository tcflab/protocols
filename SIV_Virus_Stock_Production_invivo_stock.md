# SIV Virus Stock Production 
## For In Vivo Use
### Note: Virus stocks that are intended for use in vivo are produced in a similar manner to those intended for in vitro use. The main difference is that stocks for in vivo use are ultimately expanded on PBMC isolated from macaques while in vitro stocks are grown on CEMx174 cells. This is to avoid potential xeno reactivity between virus that has incorporated proteins from a human cell line with the macaques that are challenged with this virus stock. Consideration of PBMC donors is important. Blood should be drawn from animals that are part of the SPF colony and have no previous exposure to SIV or related viruses or vaccines. 

## Materials:

Phosphatase (CIP or SAP)

T4 DNA ligase

Pellet Paint NF reagent (Millipore Sigma 70748)

DEPC water

100% and 70% EtOH

Lipofectamine 2000 (ThermoFisher 11668-027)

Serum-free RPMI

R10 media supplemented with 20 U/ml IL-2

## Procedure
Day -1: Plate adherent cells; Prepare DNA

1. Trypsinize adherent cells (Vero or 293T) and split 1:5 into T75 cell culture flasks. Incubate overnight at 37C. Be sure to use the appropriate media for the cells used. We currently have a stock of Vero cells that are adapted to grow in R10, but the 293T cells (and other Vero cells) will grow in DMEM10
2. Molecular biology steps: If working with SIVmac239 split into 2 plasmids you will need to ligate them. (Note; if you have a full-length plasmid you can skip all these steps and transfect ~2-3 ug DNA)
    1. Cut > 20 ug of each plasmid with SphI as per manufacturer's recommendations. 
    2. Heat inactivate the enzyme at 65C for 15 minutes
    3. Add 0.1 volume 10x SAP buffer and 1 ul SAP to 5' plasmid digests only. Incubate this reaction at 37C for 15 min to 1 hour, then heat kill SAP for 20 min at 65C. (Note: the 5' plasmid is cut twice by SphI while the 3' plasmid is cut only once. Therefore the 5’ plasmid digest has twice as many ends as the 3’ digest, which is why I SAP that one.)
    4. Combine the 5' and 3' genomes and bring to 200 ul total volume with sterile water.
    5. Add 2 ul thawed Pellet Paint NF reagent and vortex. (Note: if you choose not to use the Pellet Paint you will need to incubate the DNA under EtOH for >1 hour at -80C then spin 20 minutes at max speed in microcentrifuge)
    6. Add 0.1 volumes 3 mM NaOAc and vortex
    7. Add 2.5 volumes 95% EtOH, vortex and spin 5 min at 14,000 rpm 
    8. Wash pellets with 70% EtOH and spin 5 minutes at 14,000 rpm
    9. Dry pellets and re-suspend in 35 ul sterile water
    10. Add 4 ul 10x ligase buffer and 1 ul ligase. Transfer sample to PCR tube and run the ligation program on the thermal cycler (11C for 1 hour then 20C for 1 hour, repeating infinitely) overnight.

Day 0: Transfect adherent cells; Isolate PBMC and stimulate with PHA

1. Transfection:
    1. Aliquot 1.9 ml serum-free medium into two 15 ml conical tubes for each transfection
    2. Add 30 ug DNA to the serum-free medium in one of the 15 ml conical tubes and mix carefully (without vortexing)
    3. Add 75 ul Lipofectamine 2000 reagent to the other 15 ml conical and vortex
    4. Incubate the 15 ml conical tubes at room temp for 5 minutes
    5. Add the DNA mix to the Lipofectamine tube and mix carefully
    6. Incubate the mixture at room temp for 20 minutes
    7. Add DNA/Lipofectamine mixture to cells. (Leave growth medium in the flask; transfection will work in the presence of serum.) Pipette transfection mix gently, with the cell flask tilted on its side. Try to distribute transfection mix evenly throughout the flask. When you’re done, rock the flask gently to mix—don’t swirl it, as this may concentrate tfxn mix in the middle of the flask, potentially causing toxicity to cells.
    8. Incubate the cells at 37C overnight

2. PBMC Isolation

    1.   Obtain a fresh blood draw from and SIV-naive animal from the SPF colony. You will need about 1 million PBMC per ml of virus stock desired. (Ex: 100 million cells will yield about 100 ml virus-infected supernatant or about 200 x 0.5 ml vials)   
    2. Isolate PBMC from blood using ficoll gradient separation. If there is blood from multiple animals keep it separate for now, they will be combined after the activation step. 
    3. Once you have PBMC, CD8 deplete the PBMC using the the CD8 microbead kit for non-human primates (Miltenyi) following the manufacturer's instructions.
    4. Re-suspend the CD8 depleted PBMC at 1-2 million cells/ml in R10 media containing 5 ug/ml PHA-P (This is a 1:200 dilution of the stock PHA-P). *Note: You can also use Con A (10 ul of Con A per 1 ml media). If you do this you will need to wash cells after 24 hours
    5. Incubate the cells at 37C for 48 hours

Day 1: Wash adherent cells

    1. Remove transfection mix from adherent cells by aspirating supernatant.
    2. Wash gently with medium, then add 15 ml fresh media to each flask
    3. Check on PBMC; they should be forming little clumps as a result of the PHA activation
    4. If there were cells from multiple animals, now is the time to combine them. If Con A was used to stimulate the CD8- PBMC the cells should be washed twice in R10 and re-suspended at 1-2 million cells/ml in R15 with 50 U/ml IL2.
    5. Incubate cells overnight at 37C

Day 2: Replace medium for adherent cells and remove PHA from PHA

    1. Remove supernatant from adherent cells and if desired, freeze in 1 ml aliquots (tomorrow's supernatant will likely have a much higher titer, but today's could also be useful for infecting PBMC)
    2. Replace supernatant with 15 ml fresh medium
    3. Pellet PBMC and wash twice with 1 x PBS or R10 medium. Re-suspend at 1-2 million cells/ml in R10 medium containing 20 U/ml IL2 (R10-20)

Day 3: Infect PBMC
   
    1. Remove supernatant from adherent cells by aspiration and freeze in 0.5 ml aliquots for later use.
    2. Add 1 of the 0.5-ml aliquots of virus supernatant to each flask of PBMC to seed infection.
    3. Monitor PBMC for syncytium formation. Virus replication in culture should peak within 7 days, probably on day 5 post-infection (day 8 of protocol).

Day 6: Prepare for harvest by replacing supernatant

    1. In order to harvest “fresh” virus, you need to replace the entire culture supernatant the day before harvest. First spin down infected PBMC in 50 ml conicals at 530 rcf for 5 min.
    2. Save an aliquot of today’s S/N and test in QPCR. Discard remaining S/N and replace with fresh R10-20.

Day 7: First harvest

    1. Sign up for an experiment number to identify the virus stock. Label cryotubes with experiment number, virus strain, source cells (PBMC), initials and date.
    2. Spin down all PBMC as yesterday. Filter virus supernatant in a filter flask to remove any leftover cells.
    3. Resuspend cells in the same volume of R10-20 and return them to their flasks to harvest again tomorrow.
    4. Aliquot filtered virus supernatant in 0.5 ml aliquots in cryotubes. Freeze in LN2 for long term storage. Save one aliquot for viral load testing

Day 8: Harvest 2
   
    1. Repeat procedure from previous day to harvest virus again

## Notes on harvesting virus: 

While the peak of virus production typically occurs around day 7 or 8 of this protocol, it can be variable. It is helpful to collect viral load samples to help determine the best time to harvest and whether to harvest more than twice. 

## Notes about charactierzation of virus stocks:

We typically characterize virus stocks by viral load, p27 content and TCID50. Additionally, each stock needs to be sequenced to make sure no mutations were introduced into the stock.
